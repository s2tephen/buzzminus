# BuzzMinus
BuzzMinus is a bookmarklet that takes a BuzzFeed listicle and removes all content besides the list headers (usually GIFs). You can access it on the [project page](http://s2tephen.github.io/buzzminus) or just get the [JavaScript directly](https://github.com/s2tephen/buzzminus/blob/master/buzzminus.js). BuzzMinus was created by [Stephen Suen](http://twitter.com/s2tephen) but owes its existence to Cody Johnston's [buzzfeedminusgifs tumblr](http://buzzfeedminusgifs.tumblr.com) and Aaron Bycoffe's [BuzzCheat](http://bycoffe.com/buzzcheat).

## Issues
Currently, BuzzMinus only supports BuzzFeed's generic "superlist" template. It's by far the most popular format but there are other types that BuzzMinus doesn't work with at the moment.

Long term, I might create a (user-submittable) spreadsheet of "best-of" listicles that the gh-page can pull from. For now, just send me any gems you find [via Twitter](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=s2tephen) and I can add them manually. Or submit a pull request.
